Unlike in lab03, we will now try to predict the actual mpg values of the cars, instead of whether they are above or below the median mpg!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the dataset is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. mpg:           continuous\n",
    "    2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete\n",
    "    3. displacement:  continuous\n",
    "    4. horsepower:    continuous\n",
    "    5. weight:        continuous\n",
    "    6. acceleration:  continuous\n",
    "    7. model year:    multi-valued discrete\n",
    "    8. origin:        multi-valued discrete\n",
    "    9. car name:      string (many values)\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we will choose to not include `model year` and `car name` as features. For the remaining features, we again have the option to keep the raw values, standardize them, or use a one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this considered, we decide to standardize or one-hot encode all features in this section (we encourage you, though, to try raw features on your own time to see how their performance matches your expectations!).\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional step we perform is to standardize the output values. Note that we did not have to worry about this in a classification context, as all outputs were $\\pm 1$. In a regression context, standardizing the output values can have practical performance gains, again due to better numerical performance of learning algorithms on data which is smaller in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we will use to measure the quality of our learned predictors is ** Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). ** RMSE is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y^{(i)} - f(x^{(i)}) \\right)^2 } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is our learned predictor: in this case, $f(x) = \\theta \\cdot x + \\theta_0$. This gives a measure of how far away the true values are from the predicted values, measured in units of mpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Note: ** One very important thing to keep in mind when employing standardization is that we need to reverse the standardization when we want to report results. If we standardize output values in the training set by subtracting $\\mu$ and dividing by $\\sigma$, we need to take care to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform standardization with the same values of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ on the test set (Why?) before predicting outputs using our learned predictor.\n",
    "2. Multiply the RMSE calculated on the test set by a factor of $\\sigma$ to report test error (Why?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all of this, we now will try using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two choices of feature set:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. `[cylinders=standard, displacement=standard, horsepower=standard, weight=standard, acceleration=standard, origin=one_hot]`\n",
    "  2. `[cylinders=one_hot, displacement=standard, horsepower=standard, weight=standard, acceleration=standard, origin=one_hot]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polynomial features (we will construct the polynomial features after having standardized the input data) of orders 1-3\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different choices of the regularization parameter, $\\lambda$. Although, ideally, you would run a grid search over a large range of $\\lambda$, we will ask you to look at the choices $\\lambda = \\{0.01, 0.02, \\cdots, 0.1\\}$ for polynomial features of orders $1$ and $2$, and the choices $\\lambda = \\{20, 40, \\cdots, 200\\}$ for polynomial features of order $3$ (as this is approximately where we found the optimal $\\lambda$ to lie).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use $10$-fold cross-validation to try all possible combinations of these feature choices and test which is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your functions written above will be called by `ridge_min`, (defined for you below), which takes a dataset $(X, y)$ and a hyperparameter, $\\lambda$ as input and returns $\\theta$ and $\\theta_0$ minimizing the ridge regression objective using SGD (this is the analogue of the `svm_min` function that you wrote for homework last week). The learning rate and number of iterations are fixed in this function, and should not be modified for the purpose of answering the below questions (although you should feel free to experiment with these if you are interested!) This function will then further be called by `xval_learning_alg` (also defined below), which returns the average RMSE across all (here, 10) splits of your data when performing cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Even though these functions are also contained in the code file being imported (`code_for_hw5.py`), you should run the below code block so that they will use the version of the functions you have written above, and not the blank versions in the code file. "
